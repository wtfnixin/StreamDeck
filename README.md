# DevDeck

DevDeck is a customizable, open-source productivity remote control suite (similar to Elgato Stream Deck). It allows developers and power users to control their PC, trigger complex workspace workflows, sync clipboard history in real-time, launch apps/websites, and control their desktop remotely using a mobile app, browser tab, or second device.

---

## Key Features

*   **Secure Device Pairing**: Instant connection setup using scanned QR Codes. No manual IP typing required.
*   **Developer Workspace Flows**: Define custom macros and workspace launch sequences (e.g., launch a specific IDE, run a database server command, and open your project's GitHub repo in one tap).
*   **Application Launcher**: Add any native PC executable and launch it remotely. DevDeck automatically extracts and streams the application's icon to the client.
*   **Website Launcher**: Open bookmarked websites in your default browser. Features an integrated proxy that fetches the high-res favicon automatically.
*   **Bidirectional Live Clipboard**: Instantly share clipboard contents between your mobile device and your desktop in the background.
*   **Virtual Gesture Pad**: A remote trackpad supporting custom gesture bindings:
    *   **Double Tap**: Configurable action.
    *   **Long Press**: Context trigger.
    *   **Swipe Gestures (Left/Right/Up/Down)**: Run system hotkeys (e.g., minimize windows, open Start Menu, undo actions).

---

## Architecture

*   **Frontend Client**: Built with **Flutter (Dart)** using the BLoC pattern. Targets Android (native APK), Web, and Windows.
*   **Desktop Agent (Backend)**: Built with **Node.js (TypeScript)** using `socket.io` for WebSockets, and `better-sqlite3` for local configurations. It runs headlessly in the background, consuming less than 30MB of RAM (no heavy Electron wrapper needed).

---

## Getting Started (Development Mode)

### Prerequisites
*   [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (latest version)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+ recommended)`   

---

### Step 1: Start the Desktop Agent
1. Navigate to the `desktop-agent` folder:
   ```bash
   cd desktop-agent
   ```
2. Install the node packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the agent in developer mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *The agent will spin up on port `8080` and output the active pairing QR code inside the terminal.*

---

### Step 2: Launch the Client App
1. Open the project root in your terminal.
2. Launch the Flutter application:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```
   *(Or target an emulator/connected Android device).*
3. Scan the terminal's QR code (or upload the generated QR PNG) inside the client application to pair the devices securely.

## Building Standalone Production Releases

### 1. Compile the Standalone Desktop Agent (.exe)
You can package the Node.js agent into a single binary that doesn't require Node.js or npm to be installed on the destination PC.

1. Navigate to `desktop-agent` and build the source:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Recompile the SQLite native addon for Node 22 (the packaged target):
   ```bash
   npx prebuild-install --target=22.0.0 --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --runtime=node
   ```
3. Bundle the application into a standalone executable:
   ```bash
   npx @yao-pkg/pkg . --targets node22-win-x64 --output build/devdeck-agent.exe
   ```
*   **Result location**: `desktop-agent/build/devdeck-agent.exe`
*   *Note: On first startup, the `.exe` will automatically generate a persistent `.env` file next to itself with a secure `JWT_SECRET` key.*

### 2. Build the Android Client (APK)
1. Ensure your local PC has the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.
2. Ensure the ProGuard configuration (`android/app/proguard-rules.pro`) is present to prevent the R8 shrinker from removing CameraX and Google ML Kit modules during optimization.
3. Compile the release build:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```
*   **Result location**: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

## Creating Windows Installers

Once you've built `devdeck-agent.exe`, you can package it into a setup installer using these methods:

### Method A: Windows Built-in Installer Wizard (IExpress)
1. Press `Win + R`, type `iexpress`, and press Enter.
2. Select **Create new Self Extraction Directive file** -> **Extract files and run an installation command**.
3. Add `devdeck-agent.exe` as your package file.
4. Set the installation run command to: `devdeck-agent.exe`.
5. Save the output package as `DevDeckSetup.exe`.

### Method B: PowerShell Script Installer
Create an `install.ps1` script next to the executable:
```powershell
$InstallDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\DevDeckAgent"
if (!(Test-Path $InstallDir)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $InstallDir }
Copy-Item "devdeck-agent.exe" -Destination "$InstallDir\devdeck-agent.exe" -Force
$WScriptShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
$Shortcut = $WScriptShell.CreateShortcut("$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\DevDeckAgent.lnk")
$Shortcut.TargetPath = "$InstallDir\devdeck-agent.exe"
$Shortcut.WorkingDirectory = $InstallDir
$Shortcut.Save()
Write-Host "DevDeck Agent successfully installed to AppData and added to Startup!"
```

### Method C: Inno Setup Wizard
If you have **Inno Setup** installed, compile the `installer.iss` script to generate a standard installer:
```ini
[Setup]
AppName=DevDeck Desktop Agent
AppVersion=1.0.0
DefaultDirName={userpf}\DevDeckAgent
DefaultGroupName=DevDeck
OutputDir=build
OutputBaseFilename=DevDeckAgentSetup
Compression=lzma
SolidCompression=yes

[Files]
Source: "build\devdeck-agent.exe"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion

[Icons]
Name: "{group}\DevDeck Agent"; Filename: "{app}\devdeck-agent.exe"
Name: "{userstartup}\DevDeck Agent"; Filename: "{app}\devdeck-agent.exe"
```
